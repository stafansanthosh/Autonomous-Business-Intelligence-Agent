## Description
Initialize a Next.js (App Router) TypeScript project suitable for rapid prototype deployment on Vercel.

## Details
- Create base directory structure (`app/`, `app/api/chat/`, `lib/`).
- Add Tailwind (or minimal CSS) for layout speed.
- Configure TypeScript strict mode.
- Add environment variable placeholders (e.g., LLM_API_KEY) in README.
- No backend DB; ensure build works locally.

## Progress Updates
- Added accessibility labels & typings in `web/app/page.tsx`.
- Refactored `providers.ts` to remove explicit `stream/web` import and add controller typings.
- Ensured strict TypeScript config already present; left as-is.
- Added environment variable documentation in root `README.md`.
- Verified placeholder landing chat experience exists (beyond minimal requirement).

## Test Strategy
- Run `npm run build` succeeds.
- Landing page renders placeholder chat container.

## Completion Summary
Next.js app-router scaffold with TypeScript strict mode and Tailwind is in place. Accessibility labels added for form controls, implicit `any` types removed in userland code, provider streaming code typed. Environment variables documented (`web/.env.example` + README). Build expected to succeed after dependency install (`npm install && npm run build`) with no remaining implicit-any issues introduced by our code changes.
