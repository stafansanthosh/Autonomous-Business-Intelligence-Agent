## Description
Implement the two-pane layout (chat stream left, data/insights panel right) with responsive design.

## Details
- Components: ChatPanel, MessageList, MessageInput stub, SidePanel placeholder.
- Basic theming + light/dark toggle optional.
- Scroll handling & auto-scroll on new messages.

## Progress Updates
- Extracted components: `ChatPanel`, `MessageList`, `MessageInput`, `SidePanel`.
- Implemented streaming messages with incremental assistant update & pending indicator.
- Added dark mode toggle (client state toggle) and responsive mobile layout (stacked -> split on md breakpoint).
- Added auto-scroll via `MessageList` effect.
- Refactored original page logic into composable pieces.
- Production build validated post-refactor.

## Test Strategy
- Manual: add mock messages array and confirm rendering & scroll.

## Completion Summary
Two-pane chat UI shell implemented with componentized structure and responsive behavior. Users can send a prompt, stream output into a pending assistant message (cursor indicator), and toggle dark/light themes. Layout stacks vertically on small screens and splits at `md` breakpoint. Auto-scroll confirmed via effect hook. Ready for subsequent tasks (CSV parsing enhancements, metrics helpers integration). Build and typecheck pass.
